        The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React
        except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It
        runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the
        developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native
        platform via serialized data over an asynchronous and batched
        bridge.[18][19]

        React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via
        Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.

        While React Native styling has a similar syntax to CSS, it does not use HTML
        or CSS.[20] Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to
        manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native
        code in languages such as Java or Kotlin for Android, Objective-C or Swift
        for iOS, and C++/WinRT or C# for Windows 10, which makes it even more
        flexible.
